        <p>
          I'm Lokesh Goddumarri, a frontend developer with over 2 years of experience
          building dynamic, responsive web applications using ReactJS, Tailwind CSS,
          Context API, and REST APIs. I specialize in creating reusable components,
          managing complex state, and delivering clean, maintainable code in Agile environments.
          I've also worked closely with QA and backend teams to deliver user-focused solutions.
